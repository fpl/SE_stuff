    "**Python** is _currently_ the election language for the data science (including the geospatial software ecosystem, both FOSS and proprietary). In respect to other languages it is has a long history of _breaking changes_ with a  development cycle of not more than **5 years** per version. From time to time you can find changes in tooling and packages, or even big turns in the major versions (e.g. Python 2 >> Python 3 required a 10 years roadmap until the end of 2.* series, with deprecation of a lot of packages and changes in syntax)."
